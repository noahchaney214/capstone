# Capstone Project: Ray Casting Horror Game
This is my undergraduate CS capstone project.

# General Description
The project will be a simple psuedo 3D horror game made with PyGame using raycasting. The game will be hosted on a website with a database and backend to hold save state and user login information. It will consist of 5 levels, each with a different puzzle that must be solved before going to the next level. All while a feeling of impending doom looms over the player, along with some calculated jump scares throughout the game. There will also be an option to save progress.

# Object/Purpose
The purpose of this game is to provide a short, first-person, psychological horror experience to anyone in the gamer and horror gamer communities.

# Story Concept
The story is semi-fictional, based on a time that this kind of stuff wasn't outside of the realm of possibility, but the events exhibited in this game are purely fictional.

On August 23, 1986 in a small town just outside Atlanta, Georgia, a family of five were mysteriously and brutally murdered in their home. This horrific event eventually became known as the Buford Homicide. Police worked on the case to try and find the killer, but the case eventually ran cold. Seven years later, with the house still unoccupied since the event, investigator Jimmy Schoenberg of Atlanta Police Department decides to do a solo investigation and reopen the case only to find that the house is now haunted. Upon entering, the front door is locked behind him and is left with no option but to make his way through the house to find another way out.

# Intended Platform(s), Software Tools, and Programming Languages
This game will be made using Python in PyCharm for the game content, but I intend on also creating a website (using HTML 5 and javascript) that will host and run the game so anyone with a computer can find and play it.
